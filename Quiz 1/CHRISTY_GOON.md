## I'm Christy!

I am a senior in Information Sciences and I'm currently thinking about pursuing Project Management as a career.


### I really like cooking and going to the gym! Here's a routine you can do for each muscle group:

| **Arms** | **Legs** | **Back** | **Chest**  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bicep Curl | Squats | Lat Pulldowns | Bench Press |
| Zottman Curl | Leg Extension | Seated Cable Rows | Bench Press Inclined |
| Shoulder Press | Leg Curl | Pull-ups | Standing Cable Flys | Standing Cable Flys |
