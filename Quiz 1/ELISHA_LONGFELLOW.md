|Alabama| <li> 4 years old <li> Doesn't have an actual birthday day so I made his the day before mine <li> Around this time last year, Alabama had a urinal blockage that almost took his life. Male cats are super prone to this condition so make sure yours gets plenty of water! <li> When I adopted him, they told me that he was a cat off the street who wandered into a hotel and just vibed. Not sure how true that is. <li> Very lazy <li> Pretends he doesn't like me and doesn't want attention but always follows me around or crosses in front of me just to roll over so I pet his stomach. <li> Rarely meows </li> | ![image]
